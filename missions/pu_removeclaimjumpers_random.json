  "description": "POSTING: Security / Mercenary \nLOCATION: ~mission(LagrangeLocation)\nWORK EXPERIENCE: Combat Pilot (Military Experience a Plus)\nTERMS*: \nWhile conducting a survey of Shubin claims in the sector, we were disheartened to learn that a small team of outlaws have set up shop at ~mission(Location) and have been illegal harvesting resources. Worse, they have established a defensive perimeter with several orbital sentries dotted around the site making it difficult for us to evict them. \n\nIn order that we may repossess the claim site, we are seeking mercenary contractors to find and destroy the handful of orbital sentries. Adding additional difficulty to the task is that we are unclear as to the exact fighting strength of these outlaw miners. If they are given the chance to summon reinforcements expect anything from a small contingency to a full squad of trained fighters. \n\n\n\n\n*Shubin Interstellar is an equal opportunity contractor. By accepting this contract you are assuming any and all risks associated with the work outlined herein and in no way can Shubin Interstellar be held accountable for any damages accrued during the duration of the contract.\n",
