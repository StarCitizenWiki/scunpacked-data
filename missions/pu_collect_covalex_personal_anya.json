  "description": "Hi,\n\nI'll totally understand if you don't want to help with this, but if you can it would be amazing.\n\nSee, my boyfriend passed away during the Covalex Gundo tragedy. They said I would get all of Scott's stuff back once the investigation was complete, but as far as I know, it's been done for a while now and they still haven't given any indication of when I can get his property. It's been hard enough dealing with all this, and knowing that a package is going to show up in a month or two and rip open all these wounds, it's just too much. I would prefer to deal with it now and get it over with. If you could find a way to get his personal effects (Employee ID# 104) and drop them off at ~mission(Destination), I'd be very grateful.\n\nThanks for your help,\nAnya",
