  "description": "Hey,\n\nSo this is a little awkward for me to talk about, but it turns out that one of the people who passed away on that Covalex station disaster, Kyomi Santos, actually bequeathed me something in her will. I was surprised to hear it, but apparantly I'm now the proud owner of everything stored in box #173. The people at Covalex say I'll be able to get it when the station opens back up but ... this is the awkward part ... I kind of really need it right now. Normally I'd just wait, but I'm trying to start my own business (I make cakes in the shape of people's homeworlds) and the credits I get from selling it will really be a huge help. I've got a little bit stashed away now that I can use to pay for someone to deliver it from Gundo to ~mission(Destination) for me. I know the whole things a little bit irregular, but if there was any other way I wouldn't be asking.\n\nThanks for the help,\nThrace",
