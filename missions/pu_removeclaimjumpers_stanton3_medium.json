  "description": "POSTING: Security / Mercenary \nLOCATION: ~mission(LagrangeLocation)\nWORK EXPERIENCE: Combat Pilot (Military Experience a Plus)\nTERMS*: \nA recently acquired Shubin Interstellar mining claim awaiting processing was discovered to have been jumped by a rogue mining outfit who are actively stealing ore from the site.  While local authorities have been notified, there is concern that valuable assets may be harvested before an official investigation can be launched.\n\nTherefore, as is our right as claim holders, we wish to secure a mercenary force to go to ~mission(Location) and destroy the several orbital sentries that are protecting this illegal operation. Caution is advised as there may still be a few illegal miners at the location along with any reinforcements they muster. \n\n\n\n\n*Shubin Interstellar is an equal opportunity contractor. By accepting this contract you are assuming any and all risks associated with the work outlined herein and in no way can Shubin Interstellar be held accountable for any damages accrued during the duration of the contract.\n",
