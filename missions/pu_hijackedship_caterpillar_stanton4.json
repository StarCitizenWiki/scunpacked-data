  "description": "Here’s the deal - A couple of long timers got snagged pulling a job for me and I want you to spring them. \n\nA friendly mechanic has arranged for their prison transport to run into some trouble en route, venting the front door and bringing the ship to a halt. You’re gonna go, dispatch any security escorting the transport, find the prisoner manifest aboard, and use it to locate my crew’s cryopods.\n\nThe popsicles I’m after are ~mission(NameKill1), ~mission(NameSave2), ~mission(NameSave1), and ~mission(NameSave3). All have been loyal and deserve better than rotting in jail.\n\nAt least I think they've been loyal... I'm still wondering how they got pinched in the first place. I can't shake the feeling that one of them may have been doubling dealing. Tell you what, if you find any proof that one of my crew has been working with the Advocacy, liquidate their cryopod and I’ll see you get a bonus. \n\nOnce you've activated the right pods and my people are starting to thaw, get the hell out of there and let the retrieval team handle the rest. This last bit is important. See, once they’re defrosted, they're gonna be sent off to retirement. No sense in them knowing any more about my business than they already do, i.e. I don’t want these lunks seeing your face or even knowing you exist. \n\nOnce you’re back on your way, I’ll send you a hefty pile of well deserved creds.\n\nNow just in case you’re getting any ideas along the lines of “Why don’t I just free everyone?” or “Wouldn’t it be easier to shut them all up permanently?” Forget it. The politics of this whole thing is more complicated than you need to know. Just trust me when I say that if any extra prisoners get freed or die without me ordering it, you’ll be the one who pays. Want all your money? Do what you’re told and that’s it. \n\n-Twitch",
