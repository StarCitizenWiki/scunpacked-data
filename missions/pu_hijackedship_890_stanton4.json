  "description": "An executive client just informed us that their 890 Jump had been intercepted at ~mission(Location) and boarded by outlaws. They would prefer to have this handled privately owing to the sensitive nature of proprietary data that's being stored aboard. \n\nYour first priority will be to clear all outlaws as quickly as possible so that a recovery team can be dispatched to return the ship to the owner. The longer the outlaws have control of the vessel, the higher the chance it will be lost. I recommend you acquire a team for this outing to expedite matters. \n\nNote that thanks to a small contingent of Security Personnel who stayed aboard, all surviving members of the crew were able to flee in an escape craft. The current status of the remaining security is unknown, but just in case, keep an eye out for friendlies when you engage the hostiles.\n\nSecondly, if at all possible, the client is *very* interested in preventing the theft of the aforementioned data. If you are able to stop the theft of their confidential data stores before they are transmitted, a generous bonus will be issued.\n\nNeedless to say, this is a client I would very much like to keep happy. \n\nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Service Group",
