  "description": "HURSTON DYNAMICS\nOUTSOURCING DEPARTMENT\n\nCONTRACT: Facility Sweep & Package Retrieval\nCONTRACTOR AFFILIATION: Independent\nOUTSOURCE MANAGER: G. Livingston\nRISK ASSESSMENT: High\nRUSH CONTRACT: Yes\n\nHurston has learned that the Nine Tails are attacking ~mission(Location|address). Our on-site forces have suffered heavy casualties and stopped responding to comms. Initial reports indicated that the gang was attempting to obtain confidential material recently delivered to the facility. Thankfully, we have security measures in place that should give us time to respond. We need an operative to head to the facility immediately, retrieve those boxes, and deliver them to a secure location.\n\nYou and whatever backup you choose to bring are authorized to take any actions necessary when confronting the trespassers. Suspects are considered armed and dangerous. Hurston will not provide material support and/or updates regarding the status of the facility's security forces. \n\nThe confidential materials were discreetly delivered alongside other boxes in a consignment and locked in our automated vault with access codes kept on datapads held by senior security staff. However, there’s a strong chance Nine Tails may already have gotten their hands on them. You’ll need to find those datapads and then enter the codes at the package conveyor to retrieve the confidential materials. Payment will be sent once they have been delivered to ~mission(dropoff1|address). \n\n\n** The information transmitted may contain confidential and/or privileged material. Any review, retransmission, dissemination, or other use of or taking action in reliance upon this information by persons or entities other than the intended recipient is prohibited. **",
