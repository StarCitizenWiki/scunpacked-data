  "description": "POSTING: Security / Mercenary \nLOCATION: ~mission(LagrangeLocation)\nWORK EXPERIENCE: Combat Pilot (Military Experience a Plus)\nTERMS*: \nWe just received word that a Shubin contractor was chased off one of our claims by outlaws who are operating there illegally. Further complicating matters, they have set up a few orbital sentries to protect themselves while they mine. \n\nOur hope is to contract with a mercenary who can search for and destroy the sentries at ~mission(location). If you do encounter an illegal miner at the site, be mindful that it is common practice for these types to contact reinforcements for assistance. It might be better to neutralize them as quickly as possible before they can do so. \n\n\n\n\n*Shubin Interstellar is an equal opportunity contractor. By accepting this contract you are assuming any and all risks associated with the work outlined herein and in no way can Shubin Interstellar be held accountable for any damages accrued during the duration of the contract.\n",
