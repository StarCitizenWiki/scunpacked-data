  "description": "My brother was one of those people who died when that Covalex station near Crusader blew. Even worse, he was borrowing something of mine when it happened. Now some red tape asshole is trying to tell me that I have to wait to get my stuff back. Yeah right. First you kill my brother and now you want me to be patient? The nerve of these corporate jillos. Forget that. Instead, I figured I'd hire someone to go to Gundo to get my stuff and take it to ~mission(Destination) for me. I mean, what the hell are they gonna do about it? Anyway, it's what my brother would have wanted. It's gonna be the box marked 156.\n\n- Ed",
