  "description": "*FOR IMMEDIATE SYSTEM-WIDE RELEASE*\n\nA hostile fleet of ships equipped with quantum jammers have created a blockade around  ~mission(Location|address), disabled the station's defensive turrets, and stolen a large supply of Zeta-Prolanide. In response, the CDF has received authorization to activate its volunteer force. \n\nThough the overall situation is dire, the theft of the Zeta-Prolanide is our priority. Without direct action, the loss of the sector's Zeta-Prolanide stores could have a devastating effects to the wider economy of the whole system. \n\nWhile local security forces are investigating the incursion, they've tracked the stolen inventory to several locations. CDF volunteers are tasked with heading to these locations, recovering the stolen Zeta-Prolanide, and transferring it back to the station before the material completely degrades and is no longer viable. Just be careful, intel suggests that larger clusters of Zeta-Prolanide have a higher outlaw presence.\n\nSince time is of the essence, having a tractor beam to assist in moving the cargo is highly advised.\n\nAs an added incentive, volunteers will receive regular bonus payments for their combined efforts.",
