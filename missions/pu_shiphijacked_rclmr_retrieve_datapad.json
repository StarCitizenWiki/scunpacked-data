  "description": "Ran into a bit of crap luck that I'm hoping you can help me right.\n\nA few days ago, I hired the crew of the 'Pride of Arliss' to obtain some important data for me. They pulled off the job no problem, but the bastard of a captain comm'd me demanding more credits. Turns out it wasn't the first time he's tried to pull this trick either because in middle of \"negotiating\" with me, his ship was attacked by some very pissed off individuals looking to teach him a lesson.\n\nOur comm got cut off when the shooting started and that was the last I heard from him. I'm guessing he's as good as ghosted, but I want you to head to the Pride of Arliss and try to get my data off the captain's personal datapad.\n\nOnce you have it, I set up a secure transmission channel at the ARC-L1 rest stop. Travel there and when you're in range, submit the data to me through this contract to get paid.\n  \nDonâ€™t try to screw me over either. Karma can be a real asshole.\n",
