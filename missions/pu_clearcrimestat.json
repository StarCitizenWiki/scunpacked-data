  "description": "Hey there. I heard you ended up in Klescher which is a real drag. But it might actually be a lucky day for both of us.\n\nLong story short, I had somebody sneaking a datachip out of the prison, but they never got back to me. I know for a fact they haven’t left the facility, so I think something might have happened to them. While tragic, business must carry on. If you can get the chip and finish the job, I can clear your crimestat for you. What do you say?\n\nOf course, I don't know exactly how far they got, but I can tell you that the prison's got a whole network of hidden tunnels my guy was planning on using to make his escape. My guess is his corpse is rotting away somewhere there.\n\nOnce you find the body, I’m hoping the chip will still be on him. When you’ve got it, finish escaping and get the data to me. There’s a spot nearby you can upload the chip’s contents. \n\nOne warning though, you might want to watch out for Hurston Security. They've been a hassle lately, so I wouldn't be surprised if you ran into them.\n\nWhen I've got the data I’ll wipe your crimestat and then, voila, you’ll be free and clear. What you do after that is entirely up to you.",
