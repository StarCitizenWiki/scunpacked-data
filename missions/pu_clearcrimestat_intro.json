  "description": "Hi there. We haven’t had a chance to work together yet but I’m in a bit of a bind here and I could use another body. Not for nothing, of course. I’m all for a good quid pro quo.\n\nOne of my associates who was serving some time in Klescher was supposed to bring me a datachip, but then they went quiet. Now I’m assuming they’re dead, but here’s the deal: if you finish his job, I wipe your crimestat. Not bad, right?\n\nYour predecessor was apparently planning on using some old tunnels to make his escape. He made it sound like they weren't exactly the easiest thing to access, but I trust you can figure it out. I'm guessing you'll find his body somewhere in there and if we’re lucky, he'll still have the chip on him.\n\nOnce you get it, finish getting out however you can. Then get the data to me. There’s a spot nearby you can upload the chip’s contents. You might want to watch out for Hurston Security, though. They've been a hassle lately, so I wouldn't be surprised if you ran into them. After I get the data and validate it, I’ll wipe your crimestat. \n\nThen you can go and enjoy your newfound freedom. If you do this right, maybe I’ll have more lucrative work for you down the line.",
