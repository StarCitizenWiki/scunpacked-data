  "description": "ECKHART SECURITY, LLC.\nCONTRACTS & DISPATCH\n\nCONTRACT TYPE: Cargo Retrieval\nCONTRACTOR STATUS: Independent\nApproval code: = ~mission(approvalcode)\n\n\nSince you’ve already successfully completed a similar job, I’m hoping you’re available to help on this one. Your experience and expertise could be the difference between success or failure. \n\nI have another contractor working at ~mission(Location|Address) to recover cargo from an attacked ship, but the reports coming in make it clear the hostiles in the area aren’t going to let them do it without a fight.    \n\nConsidering the escalation of danger, and the importance of recovering the cargo, I’ve been authorized to hire additional contractors to support the operation. If you’re interested and available, you’ll need to help locate the destroyed ship at ~mission(Location) and repel any other forces attempting to grab the cargo. When the shipment is secured, it needs to be delivered to the designated delivery location.\n\nYou know the drill since you’ve already done one of these ops, but I’m gonna say it again anyways. I recommend that you come well equipped and prepared to fight.    \n\nPayment will be issued upon successful completion of contract.\n\nThis contract is non-negotiable.\n\nThis message may contain confidential, proprietary, privileged and/or private information.
