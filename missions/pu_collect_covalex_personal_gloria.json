  "description": "My son Nico was sadly among the victims of the tragic accident at Covelex's Gundo station and they still haven't returned all of his personal possessions to me. I understand that they have to do things according to regulations, but it seems unconscionable that they wouldn't make some allowances for the grieving family members. To that end, I'm seeking someone who will be able to go to the station for me. To be clear, Gundo is currently considered off limits, meaning that this would not be above board, but I feel my situation warrants special consideration. My sister says that the rate I am offering is the correct amount for retrieving the crate with Nico's belongings (#964) and bringing them to ~mission(Destination), so hopefully I can find a competent individual to settle this matter quickly.\n\nSincerely,\nGloria Theolone",
