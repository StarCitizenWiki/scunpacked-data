    "description": "A subdivision of Crusader Industries, Crusader Security was created after the company purchased Stanton II from UEE in 2865 to perform general policing duties for Orison and the surrounding sector. Preferring to maintain a streamlined protective force, Crusader Security relies heavily on security contractors to bolster their peacekeeping efforts. They strive to maintain a professional and courteous demeanor that will make Crusader employees and visitors feel safe and comfortable.",
