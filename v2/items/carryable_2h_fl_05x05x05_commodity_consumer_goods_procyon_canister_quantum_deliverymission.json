  "Description": "An extremely heat resistant epoxy often used in the mounting and repair of ship thrusters. It is considered very difficult to transport in its uncured state as it becomes explosively unstable when exposed to Chan-Eisen fields during quantum travel. Specialized containers must be used to safely transport the epoxy long distances. Once set and cured, the Diluthermex is no longer reactive.",
