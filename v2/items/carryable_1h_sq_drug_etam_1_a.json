  "Description": "Created from the leaves of indigenous plants, E'tam is an organic hallucinogenic drug used by the Xi'an to slow body function and focus in order to achieve a deeper meditative state. For Humans, the effects are much more severe. E'tam causes hyper awareness, cognitive enhancement and improved focus. Users can be so engrossed in tasks that they neglect to eat, sleep or take care of other body functions.",
