  "Description": "This small metal stand flies a holographic flag of the United Planets of Earth (UPE). Designed in 2523 when Humanity replaced the United Nations of Earth (UNE) with a new political system better suited for its expanding governance over multiple systems. To symbolize this progression, the UPE flag kept the interlocking rings from the UNE flag while adding a circle with breaks to represent the continued desire to expand and laurel branches symbolizing the success of Humanity's space exploration.",
