  "Description": "Manufacturer: Thermyte Concern\nItem Type: Mining Gadget\n\nLaser Instability: -70%\nCluster Modifier: 30%\n\nResistance: 10%\n\nThe BoreMax helps focus laser power to reduce instability significantly, while also keeping clusters of valuable deposits together upon shattering. While it does make it more difficult and time-consuming to bypass the deposit's resistance, most miners find the extra safety and increased yield worth the extra effort.\n\nManufacturer Warning! Using more than one mining gadget per deposit can result in a catastrophic explosion.\n",
