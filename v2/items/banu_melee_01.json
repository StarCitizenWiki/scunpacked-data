  "Description": "Manufacturer: Banu\nItem Type: Knife\nClass: Melee\n\nSize: 16 cm\n\nBanu engineering and ingenuity combine in the Njakte knife. Its distinct curved blade and serrated edge is rust resistant and remains ultra-sharp even after extensive use thanks to a special metal alloy that's a trade secret of the souli that manufacturers it. The intricately detailed handle gives it a distinctly Banu visual style and provides texture to ensure a great grip.",
