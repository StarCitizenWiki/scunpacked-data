  "Description": "NDR: 23\nHEI: 10\nEffects: Hydrating, Energizing\n\nThe Blue Bilva is known for its distinctive rich flavor; which is highly astringent, aromatic and very high in fructose. The fruit can also be identified by its slightly pointed, ovoid shape, and dark blue to indigo skin. The fibrous flesh of the bilva clings firmly to its large stone which is so hard that it can only be cracked through mechanical means. It takes about 11 months to ripen on the tree. It is commonly eaten dried or turned into brandy.",
