The strong tip and wide belly of the blade make the Zogo knife particularly durable, a crucial feature in survival situations in which this blade excels. The proprietary metal alloy used in the knife's design is also rust-resistant and remains ultra-sharp even after extensive use while the intricately detailed handle gives it a distinctly Banu style and provides texture to ensure a tight grip.",
