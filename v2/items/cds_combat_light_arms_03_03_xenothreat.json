This light armor will keep you fast on your feet with its strategic mix of protective plating and reinforced nano-weave fabrics. While the armor works with any undersuit, it was specifically designed to match the FBL-8u undersuit with special attention given to how the two fit together to make the set as streamlined and responsive as possible.",
