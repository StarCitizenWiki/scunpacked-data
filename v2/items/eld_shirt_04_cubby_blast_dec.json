  "Description": "Show your support for local and independently owned businesses with this Cubby Blast t-shirt. From its infectious holo-jingle promising \"racks of rifles, stacks of shotguns, piles of pistols\" to Clor Vee, the eccentric owner with a thick Cathcart accent, Cubby Blast remains one of Area18's most unique shops, and a refreshing change of pace from the corporate-owned chain stores that dominant the Empire.\n",
