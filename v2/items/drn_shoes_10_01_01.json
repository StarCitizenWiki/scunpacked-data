  "Description": "For their simplicity, the Torga shoes are as timeless as they are comfortable. The synthetic leather used in their construction is wear-resistant and sure to keep shining even with only the occasional polish. The line that separates the vamp of the shoe from the rest of the toe draws the eye making this otherwise understated design stand out.",
